# Data-science-code
We calculate permutation feature importance scores using the Eli5 package in Python. We use a Neural Network classifier and our overall task is binary classification.
Further specifications about our applied methods can be found in the paper "" in this repository.

Data and code can be downloaded from this GitHub repesotory. Filepath to import the data has to be changed and the code must be run in Jupyter Notebook for correct display of the IPython objects created during our analysis.
